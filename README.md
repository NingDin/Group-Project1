3. dailt up down occurance tend to become 50 50 even distributed. 3 days above consective up to to be rare, based on 1993 data - 6 days or above tend to become 
  extremly rare case: 98.08% consecutive upday below or equal 6 days; questions araise: is each day's return are independ probability or sth else? is 6 days above 
  can be used as a immediate reversal signal? what about overlap other factors on 5 or 4 days? since the occurance is less rare and comparable meanningful as well.
4.rolling 5 days ATR suggest we are at daily high-low true range 1.616% compare rolling 50years historical realize vol at 1.314% daily. we are at high vol regime;
